# Chip 8 Interpreter Project
This project is primarily a learning journey.

The goals I'm seeking with this project are:

1) Learn about emulation and how to develop an emulator
2) Learn how to work on a large programming project and what it entails
3) Learn the rust language
4) Learn how to use git and GitHub.
